    <h2>Interface Overview:</h2>
  
    <h3>1. Permission Categories:</h3>
    <p>Permissions are grouped into six categories for simplification, including Read, Write, Read_Execute, Modify, Full_control, and Special Permissions. These categories help organize the 13 actual permissions into manageable groups for users to understand better.</p>
  
    <h3>2. Inheritance Checkboxes:</h3>
    <p>Inheritance status is represented by checkboxes, indicating whether a file or folder inherits permissions from its parent. Users can manage inheritance by checking or unchecking these boxes, affecting how permissions are propagated.</p>
  
    <h2>Using Permissions and Inheritance:</h2>
  
    <h3>1. Viewing and Modifying Permissions:</h3>
    <p>Users can access permission settings for a file or folder through the interface. They can view existing permissions, add new permissions, or modify existing ones based on their needs.</p>
  
    <h3>2. Understanding Inheritance:</h3>
    <p>When managing permissions, users should consider whether they want a file or folder to inherit permissions from its parent. Disabling inheritance allows for customizing permissions independently from the parent folder.</p>
  
    <h3>3. Effective Permissions:</h3>
    <p>The "Effective Permissions" feature provides users with a comprehensive view of the permissions they have for a specific file or folder. It considers both direct permissions and those inherited from parent folders, giving users clarity on what actions they can perform.</p>
