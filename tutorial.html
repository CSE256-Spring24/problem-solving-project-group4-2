    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <p>Files and folders can inherit permissions from their parent folders. This inheritance can be turned off for specific files/folders.</p>

    <h2>Key Principles:</h2>
    <li>Direct permissions take precedence over inherited permissions.</li>
    <li>Permissions closer to the file take precedence over those further away.</li>
    <li>"Deny" permissions override "allow" permissions at the same level.</li>
    <li>User and group permissions have the same priority.</li>

     <h2>Resolving Permissions Issues:</h2>
        <li>When a user tries to access a file, Windows looks at all direct permissions for that user or their groups.</li>
        <li>If any "deny" permissions are found, access is denied.</li>
        <li><strong>If no "deny" permissions are found, but there are "allow" permissions, access is granted.</strong></li>
        <li>If no explicit permissions are found, and inheritance is enabled, Windows looks at the parent folder's permissions.</li>
        <li>If no relevant permissions are found after checking inheritance, access is denied.</li>
